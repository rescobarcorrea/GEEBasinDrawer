Cloud based watersheet delineation with GEE and pysheds


With Goggle Earth Engine API and the python library pysheds, it's possible to automate watersheet delineation on the cloud. 

I created this google Colab book, where I demostrate and small example. 

There are many potential improvements and applications, such as a completely near real time runoff-water discharge model, all from satellites. 

Please find attached the ipynb, and here the link to the colab file.
